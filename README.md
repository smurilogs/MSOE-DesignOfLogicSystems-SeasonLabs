# MSOE | EE3900B Design of Logic Systems Labs

## About the Project

This repository brings up an introductory series of implementations on how to design Logic Systems when dealing with FPGA's using VHDL as hardware description language. The concepts covered in this series help you to understand basics on structural style  behavioral style as well as implementing FSM-based components.

The series presented here is a throwback of a course called EE3900B Design of Logic Systems, taken by me as international student back in the Fall of 2014 at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). For this course, for testing implementations, it was used the DE1 Terasic Development Board which has a Cyclone II FPGA integrated circuit embedded on it. However the general concepts covered touch a lot of concepts that are common sense for lots applications, not only for building CPU components but also to build a wide variety of peripherals that can be integrated on developing digital systems.
