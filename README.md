# MSOE | EE3900B Design of Logic Systems Labs

## About the Project

This repository brings up an introductory series of implementations on how to design Embedded Systems when dealing with registers level using C/C++ Programming language. The concepts covered in this series help you to understand the general working of modern microcontrollers, including many of their common peripherals.

The series presented here is a throwback of a course called EE2920 Embedded Systems, taken by me as international student back in the Fall of 2014 at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). For this course, the microcontroller used was the ATmega328P, famous to compose Arduino boards such as Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano. However the general concepts covered touch a lot of concepts that are common sense for lots of modern microcontrollers, so the knowledge obtained from this course can be easily used to better understand the internal architecture other devices and build firmware for them. 


## Table of Contents

The series requirements and content is shown in detail by the section for each lab. The following content topics present each lab's title to present to you a general idea of what it approached in this serie: 

* Lab 1: Introduction to Structural and Behavioral Styles
* Lab 2: Design of an Adder-Subtractor Component
* Lab 3: Introduction to FSM-based Components
* Lab 4: Design of a Washing Machine Controller
* Lab 5: Design of Multiplexers and Registers
* Lab 6: Design of CPU Arithmetic Logic Units
* Lab 7: Design of CPU Datapaths
* Lab 8: Design of CPU Control Units
* Lab 9: Final Project Assembly
