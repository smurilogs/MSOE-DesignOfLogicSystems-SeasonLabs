# MSOE | EE3900B Design of Logic Systems Labs

## About the Project

This repository brings up an introductory series of implementations on how to design Logic Systems when dealing with FPGA's using VHDL as hardware description language. The concepts covered in this series help you to understand basics on structural style  behavioral style as well as implementing FSM-based components.

The series presented here is a throwback of a course called EE3900B Design of Logic Systems, taken by me as international student back in the Fall of 2014 at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). For this course, for testing implementations, it was used the DE1 Terasic Development Board which has a Cyclone II FPGA integrated circuit embedded on it. However the general concepts covered touch a lot of concepts that are common sense for lots applications, not only for building CPU components but also to build a wide variety of peripherals that can be integrated on developing digital systems.

## Table of Contents

The series requirements and content is shown in detail by the section for each lab. The following content topics present each lab's title to present to you a general idea of what it approached in this serie: 

* Lab 1: Introduction to Structural and Behavioral Styles
* Lab 2: Design of an Adder-Subtractor Component
* Lab 3: Introduction to FSM-based Components
* Lab 4: Design of a Washing Machine Controller
* Lab 5: Design of Multiplexers and Registers
* Lab 6: Design of CPU Arithmetic Logic Units
* Lab 7: Design of CPU Datapaths
* Lab 8: Design of CPU Control Units
* Lab 9: Final Project Assembly
